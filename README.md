# Installer

This is the installer for the CMS [Icybee](http://icybee.org). It provides a nice interface to
check the requirements for the CMS, setup the database, create the admin account and a website,
and create the configurations required to run Icybee.

The user interface is currently available in English and French. The language can be changed on
the fly at any step of the install process.
